# Kotlin Reactive Stock Service

This project is a Kotlin service that offers both REST (Representational State Transfer) and RSocket interfaces to stream randomly generated stock prices in real time. It uses reactive programming to handle data asynchronously and efficiently.

It is a demonstration service that works as the back-end for the [stock-client and stock-ui modules](https://github.com/borrelunde/stock-client) to showcase its functionality.

The project is following an [IntelliJ IDEA tutorial](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot/) that shows how to build Reactive applications with Kotlin, Spring, Java and JavaFX.
